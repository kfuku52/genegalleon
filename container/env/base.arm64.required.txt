# Merged from former BUSCO-specific environment.
# NOTE: Trinity + jellyfish are currently excluded on arm64:
# - Trinity is not reliably solvable in the strict channel profile.
# - The available arm64 "jellyfish" package is Python-only and does not
#   provide the required jellyfish CLI binary.
# BUSCO itself is installed from upstream git tag 6.0.0 via pip
# to avoid conda sepp/gsl solver conflicts.
